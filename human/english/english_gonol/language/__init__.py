"""English lexical evidence over a UCNS-owned relational carrier.

Owned by English Gonol Construction (``research/english-gonol/``), moved from
EDCM without redesign. Frozen schema/commit identities are retained.

# === MODULE_BUILD ===
# id: edcm_language_package
#   module_name: language
#   module_kind: engine
#   summary: exposes exact OEWN evidence, reversible lexical candidates, and independent English-to-UCNS relational branch construction without owned geometry; moved from EDCM into English Gonol Construction
#   owner: Erin Spencer
#   public_surface: source, affix, rendering, morphology, model, manifest, and relational-bridge names listed in __all__
#   internal_surface: none
#   auth_boundary: exact OEWN and UCNS producer commits; English Gonol Construction owns the construction; EDCM may evaluate outputs
#   storage_boundary: caller-selected lexical artifact directory
#   network_boundary: none
#   user_data_boundary: public licensed lexical evidence only
#   admin_only: false
#   tests: tests.test_language_full_run, tests.test_language_relational_bridge
#   rollout: explicit lexical-floor construction; no measurement or higher-language activation
#   rollback: remove relational bridge while retaining source evidence modules
#   requires: edcm_language_manifest, edcm_language_model, edcm_language_oewn_source, edcm_language_affixes, edcm_language_rendering, edcm_language_morphology, edcm_language_relational_bridge
#   since: 2026-08-16
#   unresolved: UCNS geometry and higher-gonol composition remain absent; lexical decomposition remains dictionary-and-inventory bounded evidence
